/**
Challenge: 

- Start building out the BoredBot Skeleton however you'd like. 
    That will include:
    - A title for the app ("BoredBot" might be a good start ðŸ˜‰)
    - A placeholder element that will be populated with the random 
      idea we get from the API
    - A button to click for triggering the GET request to the Bored API. 
      (Don't worry about implementing the button quite yet)
*/

document.getElementById('btn-get').addEventListener('click', function() {
    fetch("https://apis.scrimba.com/bored/api/activity")
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        console.log(data)
        document.getElementById("activity-name").textContent = data.activity
    })
})
